## Project Structure

- `app/`: Contains the main application code
  - `page.tsx`: The main page component showcasing all the StyleUI components
  - `layout.tsx`: The root layout component
- `components/`: Contains all the custom components
- `lib/`: Contains utility functions and configurations

## Usage

Each component is showcased on the main page with a "View Code" button that reveals the component's source code. You can easily copy the code and integrate it into your own projects.
